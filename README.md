# DappMyMusic
DappMyMusic is a decentralized web application music blog. DMM, DappMyMusic for short, was created to allow users to express their taste and opinion on music. 
DMM is built on the ethereum blockchain, using ReactJS and the Spotify Web API. DMM alows users to express their musical opinion while also listening to other
songs posted by other users.

- DMM creates a custom spotify web player that can be enjoyed on the application or through the user's spotify web app.
- After a user makes a new post, anyone on the application is able to view and listen to the posts.
- Users are able to 'like' posts and add it to their 'Top 5'.
